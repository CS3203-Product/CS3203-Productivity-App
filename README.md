**Uncram**<br/>
Uncram is a productivity program that helps users manage tasks through time blocking, conflict detection, and a prioritization engine that tracks deadlines and progress. An analytics dashboard monitors task completion, while a collaboration hub enables team communication, file sharing, and shared scheduling. To support focus, the program includes a timer, distraction-blocking web extension, and ambient sounds to keep users engaged during work sessions.

This README will undergo several changes over the course of our product development. Anything that is currently a placeholder will be changed according to our progression. 

**Installation Method**<br/>
At this time, an installation for the program is currently unavailable as it is currently in early stages of development.

**Current Status**<br/>
The program is currently in early stages of development. Changes and updates on progression of our development will be stated explicitly here.

**Usage**<br/>
Access and availability to the program is unavailable as the development is in its early stages. However, upon development completion, the program will be accessible on a public domain through the web included with all features.

**Development Roadmap**

***Phase 1: Task Concentration***

**Focus Timer**
+ Implement a focus timer that turns on when focus sessions begin.
+ Test UI of the focus timer to ensure it displays focus time remaining. <br/>
**Distraction Blocker**<br/>
+ Create a web-based extension that will prevent other programs from being browsed.<br/>
**Ambient Focus Aids**<br/>
+ Design sounds and small tunes that best aid concentration during focus sessions.

***Phase 2: Task Progression***

**Task Prioritization Engine**
+ Build an accessible page with an engine that stores task information, deadlines, calendar with scheduled tasks, along with providing small details about task completion.
+ Develop a dashboard category where task completion and progress can be viewed, indicating amount of work done and time spent on completion.
+ Construct a collaboration hub that allows communication with other users using the program, file sharing, and project management to track task progression.
